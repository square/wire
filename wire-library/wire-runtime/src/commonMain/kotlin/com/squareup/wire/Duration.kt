 * A measurement of time. Durations may be positive, zero, or negative.

 * Positive durations are measured in seconds, with both [#getSeconds] and [#getNano] parts with
 * non-negative signs.
 *
 * Negative durations may be surprising. The [#getSeconds] property is negative, but the [#getNano]
 * property is non-negative! To represent -1.3 seconds the seconds property is -2 and the nanos
 * property is 700,000,000.
