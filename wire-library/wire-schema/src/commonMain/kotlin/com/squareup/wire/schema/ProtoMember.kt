/**
 * Identifies a field, enum or RPC on a declaring type. Members are encoded as strings containing a
 * type name, a hash, and a member name, like `squareup.dinosaurs.Dinosaur#length_meters`.
 *
 * A member's name is typically a simple name like "length_meters" or "packed". If the member
 * field is an extension to its type, that name is prefixed with its enclosing package. This yields
 * a member name with two packages, like `google.protobuf.FieldOptions#squareup.units.unit`.
