/**
 * An invocation of the Wire compiler. Each invocation performs the following operations:
 *
 *  1. Read source `.proto` files directly from the file system or from archive files (ie. `.jar`
 *     and `.zip` files). This will also load imported `.proto` files from either the [sourcePath]
 *     or [protoPath]. The collection of loaded type declarations is called a schema.
 *
 *  2. Validate the schema and resolve references between types.
 *
 *  3. Optionally prune the schema. This builds a new schema that is a subset of the original. The
 *     new schema contains only types that are both transitively reachable from [treeShakingRoots]
 *     and not in [treeShakingRubbish].
 *
 *  4. Call each target. It will generate sources for protos in the [sourcePath] that are in its
 *     [Target.includes], that are not in its [Target.excludes], and that haven't already been
 *     emitted by an earlier target.
 *
 *
 * Source Directories and Archives
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * The [sourcePath] and [protoPath] lists contain locations that are of the following forms:
 *
 *  * Locations of `.proto` files.
 *
 *  * Locations of directories that contain a tree of `.proto` files. Typically this is a directory
 *    ending in `src/main/proto`.
 *
 *  * Locations of `.zip` and `.jar` archives that contain a tree of `.proto` files. Typically this
 *    is a `.jar` file from a Maven repository.
 *
 * When one `.proto` message imports another, the import is resolved from the base of each location
 * and archive. If the build is in the unfortunate situation where an import could be resolved by
 * multiple files, whichever was listed first takes precedence.
 *
 * Although the content and structure of [sourcePath] and [protoPath] are the same, only types
 * defined in [sourcePath] are used to generate sources.
 *
 *
 * Matching Packages, Types, and Members
 * -------------------------------------
 *
 * The [treeShakingRoots], [treeShakingRubbish], [Target.includes] and [Target.excludes] lists
 * contain strings that select proto types and members. Strings in these lists are in one of these
 * forms:
 *
 *  * Package names followed by `.*`, like `squareup.dinosaurs.*`. This matches types defined in the
 *    package and its descendant packages. A lone asterisk `*` matches all packages.
 *
 *  * Fully-qualified type names like `squareup.dinosaurs.Dinosaur`. Types may be messages, enums,
 *    or services.
 *
 *  * Fully-qualified member names like `squareup.dinosaurs.Dinosaur#name`. These are type names
 *    followed by `#` followed by a member name. Members may be message fields, enum constants, or
 *    service RPCs.
 *
 * It is an error to specify mutually-redundant values in any of these lists. For example, the list
 * `[squareup.dinosaurs, squareup.dinosaurs.Dinosaur]` is invalid because the second element is
 * already matched by the first.
 *
 * Every element in each lists must apply to at least one declaration. Otherwise that option is
 * unnecessary and a possible typo.
 *
 *
 * Composability
 * -------------
 *
 * There are many moving parts in this system! For most applications it is safe to use [sourcePath]
 * and [targets] only. The other options are for the benefit of large and modular applications.
 *
 * ### Use [protoPath] when one proto module depends on another proto module.
 *
 * These `.proto` files are used for checking dependencies only. It is assumed that the sources for
 * these protos are generated elsewhere.
 *
 * ### Use tree shaking to remove unwanted types.
 *
 * [Tree shaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking) can be used to create a
 * small-as-possible generated footprint even if the source declarations are large. This works like
 * [ProGuard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProGuard_(software)) and other code shrinking compilers:
 * it allows you to benefit from a shared codebase without creating a large artifact.
 *
 * ### Use multiple targets to split generated code across multiple programming languages.
 *
 * If your project is already using generated Java, itâ€™s difficult to switch to generated Kotlin.
 * Instead of switching everything over at once you can use multiple targets to switch over
 * incrementally. Targets consume their types; subsequent targets get whatever types are left over.
