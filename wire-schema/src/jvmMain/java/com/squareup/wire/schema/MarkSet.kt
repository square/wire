/**
 * A mark set is used in three phases:
 *
 *  1. Marking root types and root members. These are the identifiers specifically identified by
 *     the user in the includes set. In this phase it is an error to mark a type that is excluded,
 *     or to mark both a type and one of its members.
 *  2. Marking members transitively reachable by those roots. In this phase if a member is visited,
 *     the member's enclosing type is marked instead, unless it is of a type that has a specific
 *     member already marked.
 *  3. Retaining which members and types have been marked.
