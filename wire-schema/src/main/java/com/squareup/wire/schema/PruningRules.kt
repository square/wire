package com.squareup.wire.schema

/**
 * A set of rules that describes which types and members to retain and which to remove.
 *
 * Members may be pruned using either their identifier (package, type name, member name) or their
 * version (since and until options).
 *
 * Despite the builder, instances of this class are not safe for concurrent use.
 *
 * ### Identifier Matching
 *
 * If a member is included in the set, its type is implicitly also included. A type that is included
 * without a specific member implicitly includes all of that type's members, but not its nested
 * types.
 *
 * Identifiers in this set may be in the following forms:
 *
 *  * Package names, followed by `.*`, like `squareup.protos.person.*`. This matches types and
 *    services defined in the package and its descendant packages.
 *
 *  * Fully qualified type and service names, like `squareup.protos.person.Person`.
 *
 *  * Fully qualified member names, which are type names followed by a '#', followed by a member
 *    name, like `squareup.protos.person.Person#address`. Members may be fields, enum constants or
 *    RPCs.
 *
 * An identifier set populated with `Movie` and `Actor#name` contains all members of `Movie` (such
 * as `Movie#name` and `Movie#release_date`). It contains the type `Actor` and one member
 * `Actor#name`, but not `Actor#birth_date` or `Actor#oscar_count`.
 *
 * This set has *included identifiers* and *excluded identifiers*, with excludes taking precedence
 * over includes. That is, if a type `Movie` is in both the includes and the excludes, it is not
 * contained in the set.
 *
 * If the includes set is empty, that implies that all elements should be included. Use this to
 * exclude unwanted types and members without also including everything else.
 *
 * ### Version Matching
 *
 * Members may be declared with `wire.since` and `wire.until` options. For example, these options
 * declare a field `age` that was replaced with `birth_date` in version 5:
 *
 * ```
 *   optional int32 age = 3 [(wire.until) = 5];
 *   optional Date birth_date = 4 [(wire.since) = 5];
 * ```
 *
 * Client code should typically target a single version. In this example, versions <= 4 will have
 * the `age` field only and versions >= 5 will have the `birth_date` field only.
 *
 * Service code that supports many clients should support the union of versions of all supported
 * clients. Such code will have both the `age` and `birth_date` fields.
